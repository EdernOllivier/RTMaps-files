Hi Nico,

I have tried with the rtmaps files to set up a simulation of the odometric model.

nevertheless there are no functions embedded in the matrix set up.

I would like to miltiply the matrixes with themselves according to their function definition of function inside the matrix.

Impossible without Numpy in python.

So that I have programmed it with the GCC.

Best regards,

Edern Ollivier
