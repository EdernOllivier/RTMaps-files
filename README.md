Hi Nico,

I have tried with the rtmaps files to set up a simulation of the odometric model.

nevertheless there are no functions embedded in the matrix set up.

I would like to miltiply the matrixes with themselves according to their function definition of function inside the matrix.

Imossible without Numpy in python.

so that I have program it with the GCC.

Besr regards,

Edern Ollivier
